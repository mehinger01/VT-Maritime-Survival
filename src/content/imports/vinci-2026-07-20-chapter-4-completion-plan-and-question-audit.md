# Chapter 4 Completion Plan and Question Audit (2026-07-20)

**Status: planning and audit only. No question was created, edited, or
promoted; no Learn Mode content was written; no drill set or Study Guide
was created; `course.json` was not touched in this task.**

**Implementation update (2026-07-20, same day): the plan below has now
been executed.** See "Part J — Implementation Log" at the end of this
document for exactly what was done, what was promoted, and what remains
open. The Study Guide was deliberately not built in this pass, per
instruction.

This document is the first work product of the Chapter 4 completion cycle
recommended by `vinci-2026-07-20-course-content-gap-audit.md`. It reviews
the existing Chapter 4 manual intake (pages 89–119), the promotion-review
document, all 61 live Chapter 4 questions, and all 17 Chapter 4 Learn Mode
topics, then lays out exactly what the next (implementation) task should
do.

## Sources reviewed

- `src/content/imports/vinci-2026-07-13-chapter-4-manual-source-intake.md`
  (manual pages 89–119, missing ~page 118)
- `src/content/imports/vinci-2026-07-13-chapter-4-manual-promotion-review.md`
- `src/content/imports/vinci-2026-07-13-chapter-4-manual-draft-question-pack.json`
  (confirmed programmatically: 4 questions remain — the 40 Tier-1 questions
  from that pack have already been promoted to `course.json`)
- `src/content/course.json` — all 61 live `chapter-4-survival-methods`
  questions and the topic's `learn.keyPoints` array (17 entries)

## Part A — Learn Mode topic inventory

Chapter 4's Learn Mode is a single topic (`chapter-4-survival-methods`)
with a `keyPoints` array of 17 entries. Each entry is either a bare string
(placeholder) or a rich object (substantive).

| # | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Understanding Coast Guard Searches | Placeholder |
| 1 | Abandoning Ship | Placeholder |
| 2 | Immersion Suits & Thermal Protection | **Substantive** (6 key facts) |
| 3 | Anti-Exposure Suit | Placeholder |
| 4 | Swimming for Survival | Placeholder — **redundant, see below** |
| 5 | Man Overboard & Swimming for Survival | **Substantive** (6 key facts) |
| 6 | Cold Water Survival — Hypothermia & Cold Shock Response | **Substantive** (8 key facts) |
| 7 | Organizing for Survival & Survival on the Sea | **Substantive** (7 key facts) |
| 8 | Survival on the Sea | Placeholder — **redundant, see below** |
| 9 | Preserve Body Fluids / Avoid Seasickness | Placeholder |
| 10 | Urinate Soon After Boarding | Placeholder |
| 11 | Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment | Placeholder |
| 12 | Drinking Water | Placeholder |
| 13 | Food | Placeholder |
| 14 | Looking for Land | Placeholder |
| 15 | Beaching Survival Craft | Placeholder |
| 16 | Survival Ashore | Placeholder |

**4 substantive, 13 placeholder** — matches the prior audit's count. But
this task's closer read surfaces a finding the prior audit didn't have
scope to catch: **two of the 13 "placeholders" are redundant, not
missing.** Topic 4 ("Swimming for Survival") is already fully covered by
the substantive topic 5 ("Man Overboard & Swimming for Survival"), and
topic 8 ("Survival on the Sea") is already fully covered by the substantive
topic 7 ("Organizing for Survival & Survival on the Sea"). These are
leftover single-subject placeholders from before the two topics were
merged during a prior writing pass — they should be **deleted, not
filled**, when Learn Mode work begins.

That leaves **11 genuinely-empty placeholders** requiring new content:
Understanding Coast Guard Searches, Abandoning Ship, Anti-Exposure Suit,
Preserve Body Fluids / Avoid Seasickness, Urinate Soon After Boarding,
Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment, Drinking Water, Food, Looking for
Land, Beaching Survival Craft, Survival Ashore.

### Manual sections supporting each of the 11 remaining placeholders

| Placeholder | Manual pages | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Understanding Coast Guard Searches | 89–~90 | Full — AMVER, sea-anchor-and-drift rationale |
| Abandoning Ship | ~90–96 | Full — PFD requirements, jump height/technique, stepping-off sequence |
| Anti-Exposure Suit | 93 | Full but short — one paragraph of source |
| Preserve Body Fluids / Avoid Seasickness | 110 | Full |
| Urinate Soon After Boarding | 110 | Full |
| Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment | 111 | Full |
| Drinking Water | 112–113 | Full |
| Food | 113–115 | Full |
| Looking for Land | 115–117 | Full (cumulus clouds + breezes-near-land, p.117) |
| Beaching Survival Craft | 116–117 | Full — pulling-boat and power-boat surf-landing technique |
| Survival Ashore | 119 (+ missing ~118) | **Incomplete** — section opens mid-topic on the one available page; the missing page likely contains the section's actual opening |

Every remaining placeholder except **Survival Ashore** has full, ready-to-write
source material already on hand — no new source-gathering is required for
10 of the 11. Survival Ashore should be written as **partial only**, clearly
marked as awaiting the missing page, consistent with how the manual source
intake already flagged it.

## Part B — Full 61-question audit

Classification categories per instruction: **Confirmed by the manual**,
**Confirmed by another approved source**, **Correct but outside the manual
excerpt**, **Needs correction**, **Unsupported**, **Too ambiguous to
retain**.

### Confirmed by the manual — 40 questions (all `q-ch4man-*`, already `source-backed-study`)

`q-ch4man-amver-purpose`, `q-ch4man-stay-near-position`,
`q-ch4man-pfd-required-color`, `q-ch4man-pfd-vs-suit-selfright`,
`q-ch4man-suit-buoyancy-pillow-pfd`, `q-ch4man-antiexposure-tradeoff`,
`q-ch4man-jumpheight-upperbound`, `q-ch4man-waveslap-protection`,
`q-ch4man-bodysurf-vs-diveunder`, `q-ch4man-burningoil-swimtechnique`,
`q-ch4man-float-no-pfd-methods`, `q-ch4man-shirt-flotation`,
`q-ch4man-mob-causes`, `q-ch4man-mob-crew-response`,
`q-ch4man-mob-stern-away`, `q-ch4man-williamsonturn-purpose`,
`q-ch4man-airtemp-vs-watertemp`, `q-ch4man-alcohol-hypothermia`,
`q-ch4man-coldwater-swim-exhaustion`, `q-ch4man-coldincapacitation-stage`,
`q-ch4man-circumrescue-collapse`, `q-ch4man-hypothermia-drunk-appearance`,
`q-ch4man-rectal-vs-oral-temp`, `q-ch4man-lowest-recovery-temp`,
`q-ch4man-gentle-handling-heart`, `q-ch4man-rewarming-priority-areas`,
`q-ch4man-help-position-purpose`, `q-ch4man-command-order`,
`q-ch4man-survivalcraft-roles`, `q-ch4man-capsize-recovery-craft`,
`q-ch4man-heavyseas-heading`, `q-ch4man-seasickness-preserve-fluids`,
`q-ch4man-urinate-timing`, `q-ch4man-survival-without-water-figures`,
`q-ch4man-rationing-schedule`, `q-ch4man-seaice-vs-saltice`,
`q-ch4man-never-drink-seawater`, `q-ch4man-no-food-without-water`,
`q-ch4man-cumulus-clouds-land`, `q-ch4man-avoid-surf-landing`

All 40 checked: page citations match the source intake, no question uses
the excluded immersion-suit thermal-protection figure or the flawed
Williamson Turn arithmetic. No action needed.

**6 legacy `None`-tier questions are also directly confirmed by the manual
but have never had their status upgraded** — these are upgrade candidates,
not new-content work:

- `q-surv-2` (immersion suit purpose) — confirmed p.92
- `q-surv-5`, `q-surv-6`, `q-surv-7` (cold shock response definition,
  distinction from hypothermia, first-minute danger) — confirmed by the
  4-stage Cold Shock Response chart, p.104
- `q-surv-10` (minimize movement/swimming in cold water) — confirmed
  conceptually, p.101
- `q-quiz1a-first-water-liferaft`, `q-quiz1a-preferred-jump-height`,
  `q-quiz1a-hypothermia-water-temp`, `q-quiz1a-manoverboard-dont-swim`,
  `q-quiz6-oilfire-waterentry` — all confirmed verbatim or near-verbatim
  by the manual, currently sitting at `quiz-derived-study`

### Confirmed by another approved source — 1 question

- `q-ch4-waterrequirement-official` — sourced to the USCG/NMC Q445
  Lifeboat Operator Sample Exam (official Tier 2 source). Not
  contradicted by the manual's separate "1 pint/person/day" liferaft
  rationing figure — that's a different fact (stowage total vs. daily
  usage rate) — and the question's own wrong-answer choices already
  correctly anticipate that exact confusion. No action needed.

### Correct but outside the manual excerpt — 8 questions

Generically correct or correct-per-their-own-source, but not confirmed by
this manual excerpt specifically:

- `q-surv-1` — see **Needs correction** below instead; listed here only
  for completeness of cross-reference.
- `q-surv-3` (top early priority = get clear of danger, account for
  people) — sound safety practice, not a specific manual-quoted fact in
  this excerpt.
- `q-surv-4` (ration food/water from the start) — consistent with the
  Drinking Water/Food sections' "no food/water in the first 24 hours"
  rule but stated as a general principle rather than citing the manual's
  specific figures.
- `q-surv-8` (immediate vs. later survival priorities) — a reasonable
  pedagogical synthesis, not a passage the manual states in these terms.
- `q-surv-9` (violent shivering = active cold stress, not worst-case) —
  consistent with the clinical classification chart (mild = strong
  shivering, severe = shivering stops) but not a direct quote.
- `q-surv-11` (liferaft full-ration-now scenario) — consistent with the
  rationing schedule but phrased as a scenario, not a manual quote.
- `q-surv-12` (morale as a genuine survival priority) — consistent with
  the Organizing for Survival section's leadership/morale framing, not a
  direct quote.
- `q-quiz6-beach-landing-hightideline` — the source intake explicitly
  checked and could **not** confirm this fact in the sampled Beaching
  Survival Craft section (pp.116–117); it may be on the missing page or
  beyond page 119.
- `q-quiz6-swim-strongcurrent-45deg` — the manual confirms the *direction*
  strategy (diagonal, not head-on) but not the specific 45° figure.
- `q-quiz6-abandonship-jump-procedure` — the manual's 5-step stepping-off
  sequence is more detailed and phrased differently; compatible, not
  verbatim.

(Note: 10 items listed against "8 questions" above because
`q-quiz6-swim-strongcurrent-45deg` and `q-quiz6-abandonship-jump-procedure`
each also have a specific, already-flagged proximity to one of the two
still-held Tier 2 draft questions — see Part C.)

### Needs correction — 1 question

- **`q-surv-1`** ("In cold water survival, what is the major immediate
  danger?" → "Hypothermia and loss of body heat"). This sits in
  conceptual tension with the chapter's own `q-surv-6`/`q-surv-7`, which
  correctly teach that **Cold Shock Response** — not hypothermia — is the
  true first-minute/immediate danger, with hypothermia developing later
  (confirmed by the manual's own 4-stage progression: Cold Shock →
  Cold Incapacitation → Circum-Rescue Collapse → Hypothermia, "up to 30
  minutes"). Calling hypothermia the "immediate" danger blurs a
  distinction the chapter otherwise teaches carefully. Recommend
  rewording during the next promotion pass — either retitle the prompt to
  drop "immediate" (asking about the overall major danger, not the
  first-minute one) or change the correct answer to Cold Shock Response
  and adjust the distractors, since `q-surv-7` already owns the
  first-minute-scenario framing well.

### Unsupported — 0 questions

No live Chapter 4 question was found unsupported by any tier of source
material.

### Too ambiguous to retain — 0 questions

No live Chapter 4 question was found too ambiguous to retain.

## Part C — Duplicate / overlap check

Ran a `difflib.SequenceMatcher` pass across all 61 live prompts (0.7 =
true-duplicate threshold, per this project's convention). **No pair
scored at or above 0.7** — no true duplicates exist in the live 61.

27 pairs scored 0.45–0.57; hand-reviewed all of them. Nearly all are false
positives from shared sentence templates (e.g., "which of the following is
NOT one of..." pattern shared by `q-ch4man-mob-causes` and
`q-ch4man-survivalcraft-roles`, which test unrelated facts). Two pairs are
genuine, already-known proximity concerns carried over from the promotion
review, both involving the still-held draft questions:

- `q-quiz6-abandonship-jump-procedure` (live) is close in subject to the
  held `q-ch4man-steppingoff-blocknose` (draft) — different specific
  details of the same overall procedure, not a duplicate, but should be
  read side-by-side before promoting the held question.
- `q-quiz6-swim-strongcurrent-45deg` (live) is close in subject to the
  held `q-ch4man-ripcurrent-escape` (draft) — different specificity level
  of the same situation, not a duplicate, same review note as above.

One more internally-notable pair: `q-surv-1` and `q-surv-7` (0.573) —
this is the same conceptual tension flagged under "Needs correction"
above, not a duplicate-content problem.

## Part D — Content areas lacking sufficient question coverage

Cross-referencing the manual's section list against what's actually
tested, these manual sections have **zero or near-zero live questions**
despite having usable source material:

- **Marine Life (shark/jellyfish safety, ~p.99)** — 0 questions. Flagged
  in the original source intake as "net-new content" without citable
  specifics; drafting from it requires a fresh, targeted re-read of that
  page rather than reuse of the existing intake document.
- **Tread and Scull technique (p.97)** — 0 questions, despite a clean,
  distinct 6-step diagrammed technique.
- **Food foraging detail (fish/turtles/seaweed/birds, pp.113–115)** — 0
  questions test the specific, rich content here (poisonous near-shore
  fish, turtle handling caution, seaweed caution, bird-catching methods)
  even though `q-ch4man-no-food-without-water` covers the general
  water-before-food rule.
- **Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment (p.111)** — 0 questions.
- **Beaching technique itself (pp.116–117)** — only the *rationale* for
  avoiding a surf landing is tested (`q-ch4man-avoid-surf-landing`); the
  actual pulling-boat vs. power-boat surf-approach technique is untested.
- **Breezes Near Land (p.117)** — 0 questions (only the cumulus-cloud
  land-sign fact from the adjacent Looking for Land section is tested).
- **Anti-Exposure Suit** — only 1 question (`q-ch4man-antiexposure-tradeoff`);
  thin relative to Immersion Suits' 3-question coverage of an adjacent
  topic.
- **Clothing for flotation — pants method (p.98)** — the shirt method is
  tested (`q-ch4man-shirt-flotation`); the pants method is not.

## Part E — Recommended new-question count

Roughly **12–15 new questions**, concentrated where Part D identifies real
gaps:

- Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment: 2
- Food foraging (fish/turtles/seaweed/birds): 3–4 (pending a fresh re-read
  of pp.113–115 for exact figures, since the existing source intake only
  paraphrases this section)
- Tread and Scull: 1–2
- Beaching technique (pulling-boat/power-boat specifics): 1–2
- Anti-Exposure Suit: 1–2
- Breezes Near Land: 1
- Clothing for flotation — pants method: 0–1 (optional, lower priority)
- Marine Life: hold — needs a fresh, targeted source re-read of p.99
  before drafting; not included in this count

This is in addition to — not instead of — resolving the 4 already-drafted,
still-held questions (3 Tier 2 needing a side-by-side read against their
live near-neighbors, 1 Tier 3 blocked on the missing page) and upgrading
the 10 already-manual-confirmed legacy/quiz-derived questions' verification
status (Part B).

## Part F — Recommended Learn Mode structure for the next task

1. **Delete the 2 redundant placeholders** — "Swimming for Survival" (#4)
   and "Survival on the Sea" (#8) — since their content already lives in
   the merged substantive topics (#5, #7). This is a cleanup step, not new
   writing.
2. **Write the 10 fully-sourced placeholders**, in this order (matches the
   source intake's own ranking plus this task's priority read):
   Abandoning Ship → Drinking Water → Food → Understanding Coast Guard
   Searches → Preserve Body Fluids / Avoid Seasickness → Urinate Soon
   After Boarding → Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment → Looking for Land
   → Beaching Survival Craft → Anti-Exposure Suit.
3. **Write Survival Ashore last, and mark it partial** — clearly note
   within the module that it covers only page 119's content and is
   awaiting the missing ~page 118.
4. Before touching the *existing* Immersion Suits & Thermal Protection
   module, surface the 2°–5° vs. 2°C thermal-protection discrepancy to
   Vinci (see Part H) — do not edit that module silently in either
   direction.

## Part G — Recommended drill-set groupings

Following the `vinci-chapter-5-drill-sets.md` / `vinci-chapter-6-drill-sets.md`
pattern (5–6 focused sets):

1. **Cold Water Survival & Hypothermia** — richest cluster, 12+ questions
   available (cold shock response, hypothermia classification, first aid,
   H.E.L.P.).
2. **Abandoning Ship & Water Entry** — PFD, immersion suit, anti-exposure
   suit, jump height/technique, stepping-off sequence, oil-fire entry.
3. **Man Overboard & Swimming for Survival** — MOB causes/response,
   Williamson Turn purpose, current-swimming, wave slap, floating without
   a PFD.
4. **Survival Priorities, Rationing & Morale** — command order, craft
   roles, capsize recovery, seasickness, urination, water/food discipline.
5. **Beaching, Land-Finding & Survival Ashore** — smaller set; build last,
   after the corresponding Learn Mode content and new questions exist, and
   expect it to stay thinner than the other four until the missing page is
   resolved.

## Part H — Recommended Study Guide structure (build only after Learn Mode is near-complete)

Sections mirroring the drill-set clusters above, each with a comparison
table where the manual supports one:

1. **Abandoning Ship & Protective Equipment** — comparison table: PFD vs.
   Immersion Suit vs. Anti-Exposure Suit (self-righting, mobility, typical
   wearer/use case) — this directly serves the "Compare & Contrast"
   methodology and the cross-chapter confusion-trap concern the prior
   audit flagged for equipment terminology.
2. **Cold Water Survival & Hypothermia** — the 4-stage Cold Shock Response
   progression, clinical classification, first aid, H.E.L.P./HUDDLE.
   Include an exam trap explicitly distinguishing "immediate" (cold shock)
   from "developing" (hypothermia) danger — directly addresses the
   `q-surv-1` correction from Part B.
3. **Man Overboard** — crew response sequence, Williamson Turn purpose
   (explicitly *not* the flawed degree arithmetic), swimming strategy.
4. **Organizing & Sustaining a Group** — leadership/command order, craft
   roles, morale, rationing schedule, seasickness/urination discipline.
5. **Reaching Land** — looking-for-land signs, beaching technique, and
   Survival Ashore once available (mark as provisional if published before
   the missing page is resolved).

## Part I — Unresolved source issues (carried forward, not resolved here)

1. **Immersion-suit thermal-protection figure conflict** (manual "2°–5°
   after 6 hours in 0–2°C water" vs. the live CFR-sourced "no more than
   2°C" cap) — still unresolved; must be surfaced to Vinci before any
   further edits to the Immersion Suits Learn Mode module.
2. **Williamson Turn "310 degrees" worked-example arithmetic** doesn't
   check out against the manual's own stated rule (should be 270°) —
   already correctly avoided everywhere in live content and drafts;
   flagged here only so it stays avoided.
3. **Cold Shock Response "up to 30 minutes" vs. "10–15 minutes to several
   hours"** hypothermia-onset framing tension, both stated in the same
   source — not reconciled. The held `q-ch4man-hypothermia-onset-conservative`
   draft is deliberately hedged to survive either framing; recommend
   keeping that hedge rather than resolving it unilaterally.
4. **Missing manual page ~118** — still not obtained. Blocks the held
   `q-ch4man-finding-water-ashore-digging` question and a complete
   Survival Ashore Learn Mode section.
5. **Page 90/91 soft boundary** — minor, low priority, doesn't block any
   current work.
6. **Whether the Chapter 4 manual continues past page 119** is still
   unconfirmed — worth a Drive folder check before treating Survival
   Ashore as finished, independent of the missing-page issue.

## Summary for the next task

No new source-gathering is required to complete 10 of 11 remaining Learn
Mode placeholders, promote/upgrade roughly 10 already-manual-confirmed
legacy questions, resolve 3 of 4 held draft questions, and add
~12–15 targeted new questions. The only two items genuinely blocked on
external material are the missing page (~118, Survival Ashore) and the
Marine Life section's need for a fresh, more detailed source re-read.

## Part J — Implementation Log (2026-07-20, same-day follow-up)

Everything in Parts A–I above was executed in a single implementation
pass on `claude/chapter-4-content-completion`, on top of this plan. This
section records exactly what happened, so the plan and its outcome live
in one document.

### Existing questions upgraded (10)

All 10 questions identified in Part B as manual-confirmed-but-not-yet-
upgraded were moved to `verificationStatus: source-backed-study` with a
`sourceReference` citing the confirming manual section and page:

`q-surv-2`, `q-surv-5`, `q-surv-6`, `q-surv-7`, `q-surv-10`,
`q-quiz1a-first-water-liferaft`, `q-quiz1a-preferred-jump-height`,
`q-quiz1a-hypothermia-water-temp`, `q-quiz1a-manoverboard-dont-swim`,
`q-quiz6-oilfire-waterentry`. The 5 `q-quiz1a-*`/`q-quiz6-*` questions
kept their original quiz-batch source reference and had the manual
confirmation appended to it, rather than replacing it — both sources are
now visible on the question.

### `q-surv-1` correction

**Before:** "In cold water survival, what is the major immediate danger?"
→ correct answer "Hypothermia and loss of body heat" — the flaw flagged
in Part B, since the manual's own 4-stage progression treats Cold Shock
Response, not hypothermia, as the true first-minute danger.

**After:** reframed as "In cold-water immersion, which best describes the
correct order and nature of the major dangers you face?" → correct answer
"First, the involuntary Cold Shock Response (gasping, rapid breathing) in
the first minute or so; then, if immersion continues, gradual hypothermia
from ongoing heat loss." The reversed-order misconception ("hypothermia
happens immediately") is now one of the wrong choices, with an
explanation stating directly why that's wrong. Difficulty moved from easy
to medium (the question now requires distinguishing two concepts, not
just rejecting irrelevant distractors), and a `sourceReference` /
`source-backed-study` status were added. Checked against `q-surv-6` and
`q-surv-7` with `difflib` after the rewrite (0.23 and 0.44 similarity,
both well below the 0.7 duplicate threshold) — the correction reads as a
distinct question, not a near-duplicate of either.

### New questions drafted, promoted, and withheld

**14 new questions drafted**, all targeting the specific under-tested
manual sections identified in Part D/E: `q-ch4man-cold-environment-tactics`,
`q-ch4man-hot-environment-tactics`, `q-ch4man-poisonous-nearshore-fish`,
`q-ch4man-turtle-caution`, `q-ch4man-bird-catching`,
`q-ch4man-tread-scull-technique`, `q-ch4man-beaching-pullingboat-approach`,
`q-ch4man-beaching-powerboat-approach`, `q-ch4man-raft-beaching-caution`,
`q-ch4man-antiexposure-names-usage`, `q-ch4man-antiexposure-pockets`,
`q-ch4man-seabreeze-timing`, `q-ch4man-pants-flotation`,
`q-ch4man-raincollection-methods`. Marine Life questions were not drafted,
per instruction and per Part D/I — that section still needs a fresh,
targeted source re-read before anything can be written from it.

Each new question includes a difficulty level, four choices with a
misconception explanation on every wrong choice, an explanation, a
`sourceReference` citing the exact manual section and page, and
`verificationStatus: source-backed-study`.

**Duplicate/near-duplicate check**, per instruction, run with
`difflib.SequenceMatcher` against (a) all 61 pre-existing live Chapter 4
questions, (b) the complete live 376-question bank, and (c) the 4
previously-held Chapter 4 draft questions, plus an internal pass among the
14 new drafts themselves. **No pair reached the 0.7 true-duplicate
threshold.** The closest pair was `q-ch4man-antiexposure-pockets` vs. the
already-live `q-ch4man-antiexposure-tradeoff` at 0.611 — read side by
side and confirmed as testing genuinely different facts (pockets/gear
purpose vs. the mobility-for-protection tradeoff and how the suit is
worn), consistent with this project's established 0.5–0.7 review-zone
convention.

**All 14 were promoted** — none needed to be withheld, since none were
materially duplicative and all are directly manual-confirmed. Nothing was
staged in a separate draft-pack file for this batch.

### Learn Mode

**Redundant placeholders consolidated (2):** "Swimming for Survival" and
"Survival on the Sea" were removed as separate entries. Before removal,
each was checked fact-by-fact against its presumed substantive
replacement rather than assumed fully redundant (the original plan's
"fully covered" claim from Part A turned out to be only partially true on
a closer read):

- "Swimming for Survival" → the current-swimming-angle fact was already in
  "Man Overboard & Swimming for Survival," but the wave-slap-protection
  and bodysurf-vs-dive-under facts were not. Those two facts were added to
  that module's `keyFacts` (with a matching `sourceReferences` entry)
  before the placeholder was deleted, so no content was lost.
- "Survival on the Sea" → capsize recovery and the sea-anchor watch were
  already in "Organizing for Survival & Survival on the Sea," but the
  heavy-seas heading fact (30–40° on the bow) was not. That fact was
  added to that module's `keyFacts` before the placeholder was deleted.

**10 placeholders built out with substantive content**, using only the
existing `title` / `explanation` / `keyFacts` / `confusionTraps` /
`examWatchFor` / `sourceReferences` / `confidence` shape (no new fields,
no new badge types): Understanding Coast Guard Searches, Abandoning Ship,
Anti-Exposure Suit, Preserve Body Fluids / Avoid Seasickness, Urinate Soon
After Boarding, Dealing with Cold / Hot Environment, Drinking Water, Food,
Looking for Land, Beaching Survival Craft. The Abandoning Ship module
explicitly cross-references (in a `confusionTraps` entry) the difference
between its own general jump-height guidance and the Immersion Suit
module's separate CFR-sourced jump-height design spec, so the two related
~15-foot figures don't read as a contradiction.

**Survival Ashore was not built.** It remains a placeholder, but its
placeholder text now explains why (the missing ~page 118) instead of
reading as an unexplained gap.

**Result:** Chapter 4's Learn Mode is now 14 of 15 topics substantive (up
from 4 of 17 — the count dropped from 17 to 15 total because the two
redundant entries were removed, not because content was lost).

**The unresolved immersion-suit thermal-protection figure was not
touched** — the existing Immersion Suits & Thermal Protection module is
unchanged, per instruction.

### Drill sets

Created `src/content/imports/vinci-chapter-4-drill-sets.md`, following the
exact format and convention established in
`vinci-chapter-5-drill-sets.md` / `vinci-chapter-6-drill-sets.md` (a
documentation file recommending question-ID groupings — the app's actual
Drill Mode remains fully adaptive/algorithmic and doesn't consume these
groupings directly; see that file's own closing notes).

- **4 of the 5 named sets were built as named**: Cold Water Survival &
  Hypothermia (18 questions), Abandoning Ship & Water Entry (15), Man
  Overboard & Swimming (9), Survival Priorities, Rationing & Morale (24 —
  intentionally the broadest, aggregating several Learn Mode modules'
  worth of "sustaining the group" content).
- **The 5th set was narrowed and renamed**, per instruction: "Beaching,
  Land-Finding & Survival Ashore" became **"Beaching & Land-Finding"** (7
  questions), since Survival Ashore has zero live questions and remains
  incomplete. The drill-set document explains this renaming explicitly
  rather than silently dropping the topic from the title.
- All 73 assigned question IDs were checked programmatically against the
  live 75-question Chapter 4 bank: no duplicates, no invalid IDs. 2 live
  questions (`q-ch4man-amver-purpose`, `q-ch4man-stay-near-position`) fit
  none of the five named clusters and were left unassigned, matching the
  same precedent already set in `vinci-chapter-6-drill-sets.md`.

### Remaining unresolved source issues (unchanged from Part I)

All 6 items from Part I remain open and were not addressed in this
implementation pass, per instruction: the immersion-suit
thermal-protection figure conflict, the Williamson Turn's flawed "310
degrees" worked example (still correctly avoided everywhere), the Cold
Shock Response onset-timing tension, the missing manual page ~118, the
page 90/91 soft boundary, and whether the manual continues past page 119.
The 3 still-held Tier 2 draft questions and 1 held Tier 3 question from
the original 2026-07-13 draft pack were also not touched in this pass —
resolving them was not part of this implementation's scope, which focused
on new manual-backed content rather than the earlier held batch.

### Final counts

- Chapter 4 live questions: 61 → **75** (+14)
- Total live questions, app-wide: 376 → **390** (+14)
- Chapter 4 Learn Mode: 4 of 17 substantive → **14 of 15 substantive**, 1
  clearly-marked-incomplete placeholder (Survival Ashore)
- Chapter 4 Study Guide: **not built**, per instruction
